This is the first homework of neural network.
It's required to solve the XOR question by the BPN network
The algorith is on the slide of this class

I use the 2 2 1 structure.
In Input and Hidden layer, a bias is added.
(which means it's a 3 3 1 structure)
The Sigmoid function was used as the activation function.

This homework was coded by C++ and Python.
The result shows at most situation, the network trained fail and gave a wrong result,but sometimes it would work.

Useage:
Python:
with python version 3 and numpy libery
python3 BPN_XOR.py
